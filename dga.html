<h2>CW4 - Practical Exercise Web/UX</h2>
 
 <p> This is a website which is intended to show some of my favorite assignments for DGA1019 and DGA1020, this website is very basic in terms of structure. It only contains a title, headins, paragraphs, images, links and some CSS styling.  </p>
 
 <br><br><br>
 
<h2>DGA1019 - CW3 - Practical Exercise Photo</h2>
 
 <p> This task required four images, two which are low key and two which are high key. The theme required was christmas oriented, specifically titled as "Elisabethan or Carolean Christmas - Celebrating the past or the new?". This task was my favorite as I got to practice photography and lighting within a studio setting, as well as coordinate with my peers to achieve good images.</p>
 <br>
 <p> <strong> Here are some of the images I took for this project </strong> </p>

<h2>DGA1020 - CW1 - Practical Exercise Vector</h2>
<p> This task required that we traverse around Maltese towns, looking for 25 unique doors. Then we sketched the general shapes of a chosen door on a piece of paper, eventually we began designing a vector image of the door in Adobe illustrator. </p>
<br>
<p> Below are three images which include the sketch, the actual door and the final illustration.</p>
<br>
